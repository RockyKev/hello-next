When the puzzle is complete, it reveals some pixel art.<\/p><p>The player can also use Pok\u00e9mon and their special abilities to help fill in squares and make the puzzle somewhat easier.<\/p><p>The game operates on an energy meter. Filling in squares depletes the energy meter, which can then be restored by either waiting or using a currency called Picrites.<\/p><h3>Currency<\/h3><p>The game uses a currency called Picrites which can be either earned by doing in-game challenges or purchased using real money. Picrites let you fill your energy meter, upgrade your energy meter (so that you can fill in more squares before you have to wait) and unlock new areas.<\/p><p> <\/p><h3>Abilities<\/h3><p>Abilities are based on the standard (mostly elemental) Pok\u00e9mon types, and are organized as follows:<\/p><h4> <\/h4><h4>Auto Fix - Grass<\/h4><p>Using this ability fixes a random selection of mistakes made on filled-in squares.<\/p><h4>Auto Fix X - Steel<\/h4><p>Using this ability fixes a random selection of mistakes made on filled-in 'X's.<\/p><h4>Blue Force - Water\/Ice<\/h4><p>Using this ability highlights rows and\/or columns in blue which have possible moves. This essentially applies an algorithmic 'guide' for completing the puzzle, if all aspects of Picross logic are considered when a row or column is marked. However, it will not tell the player whether the filled-in cells are correct or not, only which may be played upon, based on the existing moves made.<\/p><h4>Cross Reveal - Fire<\/h4><p>Using this ability fills in a vertical\/horizontal 'cross' of cells.<\/p><h4>Diamond Reveal - Fairy<\/h4><p>Using this ability fills in a diamond-shaped grouping of cells.<\/p><h4>Freeze Time - Ghost\/Psychic<\/h4><p>Using this ability freezes the game's timer for a set period of time.<\/p><p> <\/p><h4>Hyper Scan - Flying\/Bug\/Fighting<\/h4><p>Using this ability confirms to the player whether or not all filled-in cells have been done so correctly.<\/p><h4>Rising Reveal - Normal<\/h4><p>Using this ability fills in a vertical slice of cells.<\/p><h4>Scatter Reveal - Dark<\/h4><p>Using this ability fills in random, scattered cells across the puzzle.<\/p><h4>Slash Reveal - Rock\/Ground<\/h4><p>Using this ability fills in a horizontal slice of cells.<\/p><h4>Slow Time - Electric<\/h4><p>Using this ability slows the game's timer and, depending on the Pok\u00e9mon's skill level, will stack with other abilities, slowing their countdown timers as well.<\/p><h4>Square Reveal -

Various gyms are placed at landmarks, and three different teams fight for control of these gyms by leaving their most powerful Pokemon there to guard the location. A rudimentary fighting mechanic is included for players who want to train at a friendly gym or fight to overtake a gym controlled by the enemy team.<\/p><h3>Catching Pok\u00e9mon<\/h3><p>As the player walks around, they will randomly encounter the various Pok\u00e9mon of the Kanto and Johto regions of the Pok\u00e9mon world. The player then taps on a Pok\u00e9mon to engage in a battle with it. The player may choose to throw various forms of Pok\u00e9balls at it, or throw a berry at it. Berries may change the odds of successfully capturing the Pok\u00e9mon, slow the Pok\u00e9mon down to make it easier to hit, or increase the amount of candy gained from a successful capture.<\/p><p>To capture a Pok\u00e9mon, the player swipes a Pok\u00e9ball in the direction of the Pok\u00e9mon in an attempt to hit it with the Pok\u00e9ball. More advanced throws, such as spinning the Pok\u00e9ball prior to throwing it, may be used to improve the odds of successfully catching the Pok\u00e9mon.<\/p><p>When the Pok\u00e9mon is successfully captured, it is added to the player's Pok\u00e9dex, if it is not already, and adds it to the player's inventory.<\/p><h3>Strengthening and Evolving Pok\u00e9mon<\/h3><p>The player can gain \"stardust\" by catching Pok\u00e9mon, hatching eggs, or by defending gyms. Stardust is used to strengthen individual Pok\u00e9mon to increase their Combat Points (CP). CP is one determinant of the Pok\u00e9mon's success in gym battles.<\/p><p>The player has the option of trading in Pok\u00e9mon in exchange for candies of that specific Pok\u00e9mon. The player may then stockpile their candies until they have enough to evolve a Pok\u00e9mon in their party. Evolution grants a large CP bonus and the Pok\u00e9mon becomes its evolved form, which may have different moves.<\/p><h3>Hatching Pok\u00e9mon<\/h3><p>Hatching eggs is simply another way to acquire Pok\u00e9mon.

Once three Pok\u00e9mon have been matched, they disappear, and an attack combo begins. Depending on the typing that leads the combo, and the amount of combos done, damage will be dealt to the opposing Pokemon. At the end of stages when Pok\u00e9mon are defeated, you will have a chance to catch that Pok\u00e9mon. The more moves you have left over at the end, the higher the catch rate will be for that Pok\u00e9mon. If the Pok\u00e9ball fails to catch the Pok\u00e9mon, players can use coins earned through completing stages to use stronger Pok\u00e9balls such as Great Balls and Ultra Balls.<\/p><p>As you complete stages, Pok\u00e9mon set in your party will level up and occasionally evolve.

You have a certain number of hearts that are used up when you start a battle, and once those hearts run out, you will have to wait a set amount of time for them to regenerate. If you wish, however, you can purchase hearts from an in game shop using Jewels.

The player starts the game by catching and naming a Magikarp. Progress through the game is achieved by training Magikarp, feeding it, competing in Leagues, and by random events.<\/p><h2>Currency<\/h2><p>In-game purchases are made with two kinds of in-game currency.<\/p><p>Coins are awarded frequently to the player for completing small in-game tasks such as completing League challenges, acquiring in-game achievements, and via random events. Coins can be spent to upgrade the player's training items and food items.<\/p><p>Diamonds are acquired via in-app purchases and significant events such as defeating all challengers in a League. They can be spent on other Pokemon, such as Pikachu, which accelerate Magikarp's training through unique abilities.<\/p><h2>Training<\/h2><p>Magikarp can be trained once per in-game day. The player uses training items such as the \"Sandbag Slam\" to train Magikarp and acquire \"Jump Points\" (JP). Magikarp's JP stat determines how high it can jump. Various training items give a fixed amount of JP with occasional random variation. Training items can be upgraded using in-game coins.<\/p><h2>Leagues<\/h2><p>Leagues are where the player's Magikarp competes with computer players' Magikarp in a competition to jump the highest. In each League the player must face five challengers, each with progressing difficulty. Each challenge consists of a single duel with the opposing Magikarp. The final challenger yields a unique item to the player, such as a Light Ball which will add a Pikachu to the player's home.<\/p><p>Losing a League challenge will prevent the player from competing in a League for 1 hour and 30 minutes, but this time constraint may be avoided by using an \"LP Restore\" item.<\/p><h2>Long-term Progression<\/h2><p>After the player has leveled up Magikarp to its maximum attainable level and completes a League, the Magikarp is \"retired\" and the player must catch a new one. The new Magikarp will have improved stats over the previous and will consequently train faster. The player will then train and once again compete with their Magikarp in a more difficult League.<\/p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"guid":"3030-58352","id":58352,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/0\/9536\/2939713-1120948740-origi.jpg","medium_url":"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9536\/2939713-1120948740-origi.jpg","screen_url":"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/0\/9536\/2939713-1120948740-origi.jpg","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/screen_kubrick\/0\/9536\/2939713-1120948740-origi.jpg","small_url":"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9536\/2939713-1120948740-origi.jpg","super_url":"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/0\/9536\/2939713-1120948740-origi.jpg","thumb_url":"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/0\/9536\/2939713-1120948740-origi.jpg","tiny_url":"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/0\/9536\/2939713-1120948740-origi.jpg","original_url":"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9536\/2939713-1120948740-origi.jpg","image_tags":"All
